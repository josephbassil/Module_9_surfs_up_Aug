Overview of the statistical analysis:
W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round

The purpose: Convince the investors with our data and show them that this is a good place to invest their money in
